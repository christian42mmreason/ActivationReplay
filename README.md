## 🎉 News

- [2025/11/27] Arxiv is released.

## 🕹️ Approach
-  we propose **Activation Replay**, a simple yet effective training-free solution that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs, without requiring expensive policy optimization. By modulation of visual tokens at test time, Activation Replay enforces RLVR low-entropy activations to mimick the distributions from paired base LMMs at test time.
-  We validate our approach across diverse LMMs post-trained by RLVR and diverse reasoning scenarios, including **mathmatics**, **multi-turn agents** that perform visual search in high-resolution images, and **video reasoners** that think across frames, where our approach showcases consistent performance gains across these setups.
